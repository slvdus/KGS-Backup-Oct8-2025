## Shipping Policies:

### **Legal Compliance**

All shipments are subject to federal, state, and local laws. Products will only be shipped to locations where they are legal to possess.

Users are responsible for ensuring they are legally eligible to receive ordered items in their jurisdiction.

Concealed With A Kiss reserves the right to refuse or cancel any order that may violate applicable laws.

### **Standard Shipping Process**

Non-Firearm Products: Distributors will typically ship orders directly to the user’s residence (known as drop shipping), except where prohibited by law.

Firearms: All firearm shipments must be sent to a Federal Firearms License (FFL) dealer of the user’s choice.

Ammunition: Some states require ammunition to be shipped to an FFL dealer rather than directly to the customer. Users must comply with their state’s regulations.

Shipping Timeline: Orders are typically processed within 1-3 business days, with a maximum of 5 business days during peak periods.

Tracking: Users will receive notification and tracking information once their order has been shipped.

### **FFL Dealers**

We provide a list of recommended FFL dealers for firearm transfers.

Users may choose any FFL dealer with a valid license who is willing to accept the transfer and provide a copy of their license.

### **Non-Drop-Shipping Manufacturers**

Some manufacturers do not allow direct drop-shipping to end users.

In these cases, products will be shipped to Concealed With A Kiss’s facility first, then forwarded to the user or their chosen FFL dealer (for firearms).

Orders from non-drop-shipping manufacturers may incur higher shipping fees and longer transit times.

A list of manufacturers that do not allow drop-shipping is available for users reference.

### **Commitment to Timely Delivery**

Concealed With A Kiss is committed to ensuring all products are shipped as quickly as possible, regardless of the shipping method required.

### **Shipping Fees**

Shipping fees may vary based on the product, manufacturer, shipping method, and destination. Any additional fees will be clearly communicated before order confirmation.

### **International Shipping**

At this time, Concealed With A Kiss only facilitates shipments within the United States, in compliance with all applicable federal and state laws.

### **Lost or Damaged Shipments**

In the event of a lost or damaged shipment, users should contact Concealed With A Kiss customer service immediately for assistance in resolving the issue with the relevant distributor or carrier.
