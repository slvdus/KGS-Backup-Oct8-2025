## **FFL Instructions & Policies**

**IMPORTANT! (MUST READ):**

**Instructions for orders containing FFL items. California customers, please read the CA Instructions below.**

- If your order contained a pistol, rifle, shotgun, FCU, or frame: we must ship it to an FFL in your state of residence.
- If you entered the FFL license number at checkout and we have their information on file, no further action is required. If you provided their name and/or address, we would look for them in our database. If we don’t have their information on file, we’ll need a copy of their FFL. It’s usually best to be proactive and have them email us their FFL any time you place an order.
- You can email us your FFL information by responding to your order confirmation.If you want to have your dealer send us their info, please have them email us at KGSCrewInc@gmail.com and reference your order number. Please make sure they reference your order number when emailing us to avoid delays.
- We do not have a fax machine and also do not have a phone that accepts text messages (it’s hard to keep track of sent copies of FFLs through a phone. We’ve found email is much easier) ????
- If you or your dealer need a copy of our FFL we have one available upon request by emailing KGSCrewInc@gmail.com.
- FFL orders take a little longer than our standard processing time but are usually shipped in 1-2 business days from the time we receive your FFL information.Make sure you verify with your dealer that the item you are purchasing is legal in your state and that they will accept the transfer.

## **CA Customers:**

- Gen 3 Glocks are the only Glock pistols allowed in CA unless you are LE. If you ordered a Gen 4 or Gen 5 frame or pistol, they are NOT legal in CA and will be sent back.
- Make sure you verify with your dealer that the item you are purchasing is legal in your state and that they will accept the transfer. We do NOT accept returns due to a firearm being illegal for you to possess in your state of residence.
- The California DOJ requires us to send a Firearms Shipment Verification with every firearm order. We will need the CL number of your FFL in addition to their license.

**Please have your dealer email us a copy of their license and CL number to KGSCrewInc@gmail.com and reference your order number.**
