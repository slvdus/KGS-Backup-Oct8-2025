## **Policies & Terms of Purchase:**

### **RETURNS**

If you are not satisfied with your purchase, please contact us for a Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) request within 10 business days of the receipt of the product. 

If the item is returned unopened in the original box, we will exchange it, offer you store credit, or offer you a refund, less 25% restocking fee, based on your original method of payment. The product must be returned within 10 business days of the issuance of the RMA. 

All products must be packed in the original packaging, including any accessories, manuals, documentation and registration that shipped with the product. A 15% open box fee in addition to the 25% restocking fee (totaling 40%) will be assessed on any sealed product that is opened or removed from its original packaging.

Please note that we do not permit the return of the following products:

1. Special orders and products that are custom configured to your specifications.

2. Products sold “as is” or “used” or that have been installed or used after receipt.

3. Firearms and//or NFA items that require ATF Transfer after the start of paperwork.

4. Illumination devices, electronic sights, optics and night vision equipment.

**NOTE***: We recommend that you use a carrier that offers shipment tracking for all returns, and either insure your package for safe return or declare the full value of the shipment so that you are protected if the shipment is lost or damaged in transit. If you chose not to use a carrier that offers tracking and insure or declare the full value of the product, you will be responsible for any loss or damage to the product during shipping.*

*The United States Postal Service (USPS) offers limited tracking capabilities and that there is a 30-calendar-day waiting period before USPS will initiate a trace. The customer is responsible for shipping charges both ways on returns, as well as for shipping charges on shipments that are refused.*

Our online inventory changes every day. Occasionally an item may appear on the site by mistake or the item’s description may contain a typographical error.

If an item’s description contains an error such as incorrect price and a customer makes the order, we will not process the order without first contacting the customer. If the order is mistakenly shipped, we may advise the customer to return the item in an unopened condition and we will refund the customer. By placing an order, the customer agrees that seller will be the final arbiter of discrepancies in the online catalog.
